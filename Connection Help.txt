Copy the file digitalcoin.conf from your main digitalcoin directory (the folder you unzipped) to the root AppData/Application Support digitalcoin storage folder.

For Windows:
The file AppData folder is hidden by default so make sure to enable viewing hidden files. Example: Windows drive(C:) -> Users -> *YourWindowsUsername*->AppData->Roaming->digitalcoin

For Mac:
Your digitalcoin.conf file should be moved to one of the following directories:
$HOME/Library/Application Support/digitalcoin/
OR
/Users/username/Library/Application Support/digitalcoin/

Press command+alt to show the library directory (if it is hidden) in the finder's Go menu.

You can create the digitalcoin folder before the first run or the client will automatically create the directory on the first run and then you can close it and move the digitalcoin.conf file.
